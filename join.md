## Benefits

We have set up go-air with a uniform process, associated GitHub 
tooling (like reviewable), standard CoC and a streamlined 
contributing process.

As a member, you will be able to

1. Manage all aspects of project lifecycle (from incubation
to release engineering).
1. Blog.
1. Participate in our planning.

## What we expect of members

We expect members to faithfully act in the interests of the 
go-air organisation, which means actively helping us to 
extend and improve open source analysis and verification tools
in Go.

Members can create projects, repositories and the like, but 
are expected to do so following the contributing guidelines.

We expect members to spend a significant proportion of their time
getting into each others work.  As a result, by joining you will
benefit from reviews, proposals, bug fixes from other members.
