# Joining Go-air

Go-air is a fun place to develop analysis and verification tools for Go.

## How to join

Please contact Scott Cotton [by mail](mailto://scott@mindowl.com) for more
details.

## Benefits

We have set up go-air with a uniform process, associated GitHub 
tooling (like [Reviewable](https://reviewable.io)), standard CoC and a streamlined 
contributing process.

As a member, you will be able to

1. Manage all aspects of projects' lifecycles (from incubation
to release engineering).
1. Blog.
1. Participate in our planning.

## What we expect of members

We expect members to faithfully act in the interests of the 
go-air organisation, which means actively helping us to 
extend and improve open source analysis and verification tools
in Go.

Members can create projects, repositories and the like, but 
are expected to do so following the contributing guidelines.

We expect members to spend a significant proportion of their go-air time
getting into each others work.  As a result, by joining you will benefit from
reviews, proposals, bug fixes from other members.

## For Organiations

We only accept individual members, but feel free to 
engage us via [a sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/go-air)
