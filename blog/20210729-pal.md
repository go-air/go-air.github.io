# PAL, a pointer analysis library

[DRAFT]

Behind the scenes, we are working on pointer analysis in Go.  This journey started out with 
[#45735](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/45735) and my frustration running godoc with
'-analysis=pointer'.  Luckily, recently I also had an opportunity to study the topic of pointer
analysis -- although in a context which uses a completely different technology.

In this post, I will outline some lessons learned in terms of design guiding principles. 

## From Complex to Simple

Let's be frank, pointer/memory analysis tends to be too complex.  A myriad of Phd theses,
dedicated logics, comments in issues such as the above and elsewhere leaves many 
of us perplexed or confused.  Where there is complexity like that, there are bugs, and
it takes a lot of valuable time to track down and fix the bugs.  

We need something much simpler.  But we also need something incremental.  Incremental,
simple pointer analysis does not seem to be available as of yet, but we are
indeed pursuing just that.

Getting there might be like Go's generics -- it may require several design revisions.

### Data Alignment

Luckily, in _safe_ Go code (no import "unsafe", no cgo, pointers are always aligned
with the type to which they point, they never point in the middle of something as
one would find in C and the like:
```c
int i;
int *p = &i;
char *q = (char *) p;
q++; // q no longer points to the beginning of the location of 'i'.
```

This simplifies a pointer analysis a great deal.  In particular, we no longer need
to reduce everything to bytes.


### Escape analysis

In Go, escaped pointers are moved to the heap.  This means that we do not
need to consider undefined behavior when derefencing a pointer that escapes 
-- it just points to whatever it did when it was create.  However, this
leaves us with a problem.

Escape analysis must be conservative in order to be safe.

### GC

We also do not need to model double free's or classical alloc/free
memory heaps.

### Comparison

Go permits equality comparison of pointers, but not other comparison

```go
var i int = 0
var p = &i
var q = &i
if p == q {...} // This is OK.
if p < q {...} // This is a compile error.
```

This frees us of the need to model when one pointer is less than another.

## Pain Points and Decisions

### What IR

There are lots of IRs out there, so we have decided to organise 'pal' so that it is relatively independent of
of the program representation.  This allows

1. Having a separate clean memory model.
2. Being able to apply 'pal' to different IRs, such as go/ssa, 
the gc compiler ssa IR, or staticcheck's IR, or other IRs.

### Symbolic and Meta Symbolic

What is the common factor between existing tools, such as Infer and Gillian,
which are incremental?  If you squint a bit, perhaps you will see it as I do,
and it is also in other success stories such as [semgrep](https://semgrep.dev) or 
[coccinelle](https://coccinelle.gitlabpages.inria.fr/website/).

All these systems consider variables which represent program variables. I call
this _meta symbolic_, because the program variables are symbolic, and variables
whose values are symbols, is, well, meta-symbolic.

We have decided to exploit a meta-symbolic memory model.  Perhaps that's fancy talk, 
but it is also drop dead simple.  Our memory model is just a set of memory locations
with a points-to relation between them.  This level is symbolic: each location 
symbolically represents a set of possible locations in an execution of the code under analysis.
To make that meta-symbolic, we just mark special meta-symbolic locations as opaque, or
uninterpreted.  An opaque location represents the set of all symbolic memory locations
known or as of yet to be discovered, one level _meta_ above symbolic locations.

### Values and bounds

One critical application of pointer analysis is to determine when things are
out of bounds.  For example, consider this code

```go
tab := make([]int, 3, 7)
p := &tab[3] // in or out of bounds?
```

Well, it is out of bounds.  Likewise, we may want to model that a pointer
points to the address of some subset of indices of a slice or array.  

In order to support this kind of analysis, the analyzer will need to have
some understanding of integer expressions in Go.  This pulls in a whole
host of problems, including casting.

#### Decision.

We have decided to make the analysis parametric on a value analyzer,
and to supply some very simple value analyzers to choose from.

In turns out that doing this can benefit a great deal from Go's upcoming
type parameters.  So we've decided to keep a dev.typeparams branch in
our pal repo.

## Conclusion

If you are interested in helping us publish our first 'pal' (of course
in a very open open source way), leave a note on 
[the go-air incubator](https://go-air.github.io/org/go-air/projects/1) or

Thanks!
