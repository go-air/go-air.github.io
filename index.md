## Incubator

We maintain several volatile incubator project, some of which
are too premature to publish to all, but we welcome 
enthusiasts.  If you'd like an invite to a private repo
below, please [join us](join.md)

Public incubator projects have stub main branches.  Development occurs on a branch named 
`proto` and is often highly volatile and difficult to coordinate.  However, all are welcome
to have a look and comment, ask questions, make suggestions, or even jump in as a co-designer.
These projects are generally not yet ready for functional consumption.

Currently, these repositories include

1. [pal](https://github.com/go-air/pal) -- Clean, fast incremental pointer analysis for Go. 
1. six -- sat for integer expressions ([u]int{8,16,32,64}).
2. air -- an new analysis ir for Go.
3. phidl -- a whacky blend of formulas and datalog
