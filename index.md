# go-air

Up and running again, we archived the repos on [irifrance](https://github.com/irifrance)
to start a fresh after being caught up for some time in industry.

## Public Projects

1. [Gini](https://github.com/go-air/gini)
2. [Reach](https://github.com/go-air/reach)
3. This webset ;)

## Blog

Check out our [blog](blog/index.md).

## Incubator

We maintain several volatile incubator projects which
are too premature to publish to all, but we welcome 
enthusiasts.  If you'd like an invite to a private repo
below, please add a note to the [Incubator](https://github.com/orgs/go-air/projects/1)
or [mail us](scott@mindowl.com).

Currently, these include

1. pal -- Clean, fast incremental pointer analysis for Go. 
1. six -- sat for integer expressions ([u]int{8,16,32,64}).
2. air -- an new analysis IR for go.
3. phidl -- a whacky blend of formulas and datalog
