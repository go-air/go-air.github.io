## Incubator

We maintain several volatile incubator projects, some of which are too premature
to publish to all, but we welcome enthusiasts.  If you'd like an invite to a
private repo below, please [join us](join.md).

Public incubator projects have stub main branches.  Development occurs on a branch named 
`proto` and is often highly volatile and difficult to coordinate.  However, all are welcome
to have a look and comment, ask questions, make suggestions, or even jump in as a co-designer.
These projects are generally not yet ready for functional consumption.

Currently, these repositories include

1. [pal](https://github.com/go-air/pal) -- Clean, fast incremental pointer analysis for Go. 
1. six -- sat for integer expressions ([u]int{8,16,32,64}).
2. air -- an new analysis ir for Go.
3. phidl -- a whacky blend of formulas and datalog
4. [dupi](https://github.com/go-air/dupi) -- index and extract duplicates.
